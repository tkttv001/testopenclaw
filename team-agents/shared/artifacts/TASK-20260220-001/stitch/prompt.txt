Design a premium personal portfolio website in a "Ronin Premium Dark" style.

Goal:
- Convert visitors into qualified inquiries (book a call / contact form submit).

Target audience:
- Recruiters, premium clients, and partners seeking high-discipline execution.

Brand style:
- Vibe: cinematic, disciplined, premium, modern Japanese-inspired
- Tone: confident, focused, elegant
- Color direction: deep charcoal/black base, warm paper neutrals, subtle gold accent
- Typography feel: strong sans-serif headlines + refined readable body text

Layout requirements:
- DESKTOP first, responsive for mobile
- One-page structure:
  1) Hero with strong value proposition + primary CTA
  2) About with short professional bio + strengths
  3) Services/Expertise (3-6 cards)
  4) Featured Projects/Case Studies
  5) Testimonials/Social proof
  6) Contact CTA + simple form
- Sticky top navigation with anchors.

UI constraints:
- Strong visual hierarchy and high contrast readability
- 8px spacing system
- Reusable components (buttons, cards, section headers)
- Subtle motion only (no flashy effects)
- Production-ready for React/Next.js implementation

Visual motif guidance:
- Inspired by sumi-e brush energy and zen circle composition
- Abstract ink textures as accents, not distracting backgrounds
- Keep overall look premium and minimal

Content guidance:
- Use realistic English placeholder copy (no lorem ipsum)
- Keep copy concise and conversion-oriented
