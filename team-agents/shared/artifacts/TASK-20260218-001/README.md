# TASK-20260218-001 Artifact (Builder)

## Done
- Built a cyber-modern personal portfolio MVP
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Added clear sections for recruiter audience
- Added modern UI effects (glow/grid/gradient)

## Artifacts
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`

## Verify
1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Check on mobile width (~390px): no broken layout
3. Test contact form: submit should show confirmation text
4. Visual check: hero + cards + glow effects render correctly

## Known issues
- Contact form is frontend-only (no backend integration yet)
- Placeholder content/projects need final real data

## Next action
- QA run responsive/console checks
- DeployOps publish to Vercel static site and return URL
