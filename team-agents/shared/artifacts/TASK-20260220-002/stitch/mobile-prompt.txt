Create the mobile direction for a premium fine-dining chef website (same brand as desktop).

Mobile goals:
- Fast scanning, high visual impact, elegant readability
- Sticky compact header + accessible menu drawer
- Thumb-friendly CTA and form controls

Design requirements:
- Use a 390px mobile baseline (responsive up to tablet)
- Keep 5-page structure: Home / About / Signature / Stories / Contact
- Preserve premium style with simplified hierarchy

Per-page mobile expectations:
1) Home: stacked hero, immediate CTA, signature cards in carousel/stack
2) About: timeline blocks, portrait + concise story sections
3) Signature: tasting cards with key details, clear service labels
4) Stories: list/card feed with image + short excerpt
5) Contact: compact premium form with clear field grouping

Style + UX constraints:
- Maintain dark-luxury palette and editorial typography balance
- Ensure readable line lengths and spacing rhythm
- Reusable UI primitives for implementation
- Subtle transitions; avoid heavy animation
- Production-ready output for Next.js + Tailwind
