# QA Report — TASK-20260220-001 v2

## Verdict: PASS

## Scope checked
- 5 real App Router pages exist: `/`, `/about/`, `/projects/`, `/blog/`, `/contact/`.
- Responsive behavior implemented for mobile/tablet/desktop with 390px baseline design intent.
- Mobile navigation behavior implemented (menu toggle + panel links).
- Ronin Premium Dark styling consistently applied.
- SEO baseline present (`layout` metadata + per-page metadata + robots + sitemap).
- Static export build succeeds for deploy target.

## Validation evidence
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/testopenclaw/task011 npm run build` ✅
- `npm run lint` ✅
- Exported routes shown in Next build output ✅
- Local preview returned HTTP 200 for page path (`/task011/`) ✅

## Risks / notes
- Stitch MCP execution blocked in runtime due to missing `GOOGLE_STITCH_API_KEY`; design prompts and screen specs were still produced in `stitch-v2/` for immediate replay when key is available.
