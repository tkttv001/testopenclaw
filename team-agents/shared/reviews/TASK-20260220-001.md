# QA Review — TASK-20260220-001

Verdict: PASS

## Scope checked
- Responsive basics (class-based breakpoints and layout behavior)
- Navigation + CTA anchors
- Contact form baseline behavior
- SEO/meta + robots + sitemap
- Build/lint and obvious runtime issues

## Results
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/testopenclaw/task010 npm run build`: PASS (static export enabled)
- One-page layout includes `sm/md/lg/xl` breakpoints across nav/hero/sections/cards.
- Nav links and hero CTAs correctly target in-page anchors (`#about`, `#services`, `#projects`, `#contact`).
- Contact form has accessible labels + required constraints (`name`, `email`) and submit control.
- SEO baseline present: title, description, canonical, OG/Twitter metadata.
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` generated with deployed path references.

## Notes
- Browser automation service was unavailable during QA window, so responsive check was validated via source + generated HTML/CSS + local static render inspection.
- Contact form is currently frontend-only (no backend handler), acceptable for preview.
