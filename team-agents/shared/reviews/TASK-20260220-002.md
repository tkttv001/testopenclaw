# QA Report — TASK-20260220-002

## Verdict: PASS

## Scope checked
- True multi-page routes exist:
  - `/`
  - `/about/`
  - `/projects/` (Signature)
  - `/blog/` (Stories)
  - `/contact/`
- Mobile-first navigation behavior verified (desktop nav + mobile menu drawer).
- Premium fine-dining visual hierarchy present (editorial typography, contrast, spacing rhythm).
- SEO baseline verified:
  - Global metadata + per-page metadata
  - Open Graph baseline in root metadata
  - `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts` included and static-export compatible
- Build and lint checks pass.

## Validation evidence
- `npm run lint` ✅
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/testopenclaw/task012 npm run build` ✅
- Build output shows static routes for all required pages ✅

## Notes
- Stitch API execution was blocked by missing `GOOGLE_STITCH_API_KEY`; robust fallback design package was generated under `stitch/` and implementation proceeded without blocker.
