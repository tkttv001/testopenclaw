# 2026-02-18

- User requested adding NVIDIA provider with fallback model `nvidia/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`; config was patched successfully and gateway restarted.
- Added manual cost table in OpenClaw config for `openai-codex` GPT models to improve usage/cost estimation.
- Created multi-agent web-factory framework under `team-agents/` with lifecycle, runbook, task board, and role docs.
- Established OpenClaw-only workflow (no n8n) for `Lead -> Brief -> Quote -> Build -> QA -> Deploy` and later evolved to `Lead -> 3Q Intake -> Spec/Quote -> Design -> Build -> QA -> Deploy -> Handover`.
- Created and executed sample tasks end-to-end:
  - `TASK-20260218-002` (3Q sample) deployed to `/task002/`.
  - `TASK-20260218-003` (chef sample) deployed to `/task003/`.
  - `TASK-20260218-004` (premium design-first chef rebuild) deployed to `/task004/`.
- Added specialized agents: `advisor`, `estimator`, `builder`, `qa`, `deployops`, `design`, and orchestrator role `nguoitaoweb`; removed legacy `orchestrator` agent and replaced with `nguoitaoweb` trigger policy.
- Enforced policy: coding tasks delegate through `opencode-controller` (agents orchestrate/review, no direct coding unless explicit override).
- Installed `opencode-controller` skill from ClawHub and created additional lean/premium skills:
  - `controller-skill`, `nextjs-personal-seo`, `design-web-premium`, plus role-lean skills for intake/build/qa/deploy/error handling.
- User preference locked in: workflow should only start when explicitly triggered with name `nguoitaoweb`.
- Scheduler jobs for web-factory were disabled per user request; tasks should run only on explicit user command.
- Rebuilt chef scenario via `nguoitaoweb` trigger as `TASK-20260218-004` with upgraded premium design-first structure and verified live deployment at `/task004/`.
- Added new agent `design` and then upgraded it to professional standard:
  - mandatory image strategy in design handoff
  - non-negotiable requirement that personal websites include meaningful visuals (hero + supporting images)
  - if real images are missing, use production-ready placeholders with replacement guidance.
- Updated governance docs so build cannot start without both design handoff and visual plan.
