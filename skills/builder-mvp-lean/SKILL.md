# Builder MVP Lean

## Build priority
1. Mobile-first layout
2. Clear sections (hero/about/projects/contact)
3. Lightweight visual effects
4. Clean file structure

## Handoff required
- Done
- Artifacts paths
- Verify steps
- Known issues
- Next action

Prefer simple static-first architecture for speed unless backend is mandatory.

## Model policy
- Preferred: `opencode/kimi-k2.5` or `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free`
- If unavailable: fallback to `nvidia/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
- Escalate only when blocked by complex logic.
