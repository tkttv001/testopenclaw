# Design Web Premium

## Objective
Deliver premium-level UX/UI for personal websites with clear differentiation.

## Non-negotiable
- Personal website output must include meaningful visual assets.
- Minimum: 1 hero image + 2 supporting images (service/project/testimonial context).
- If real images are missing, provide production-ready placeholders and replacement instructions.

## Workflow
1. Define brand impression in 3 words.
2. Select visual strategy: minimal-premium | editorial | cyber-luxury | bold-modern.
3. Define **image strategy** (mandatory):
   - Hero image direction (subject + mood + framing)
   - Supporting section images (services/projects/testimonials)
   - Ratio plan (16:9, 4:5, 1:1 as needed)
   - Alt-text plan for SEO/accessibility
4. Build UX skeleton:
   - above-fold hook
   - trust/proof section
   - offer/service section
   - portfolio evidence
   - conversion CTA block
5. Define UI tokens:
   - color palette
   - typography scale
   - spacing system
   - radius/shadow/border language
6. Define interaction rules:
   - micro motion (150-350ms)
   - hover/focus states
   - scroll reveal restraint
7. Handoff implementation plan to Builder via `opencode-controller`.

## Differentiation checklist
- Hero is specific, not generic
- Visual identity consistent across sections
- Portfolio cards tell outcome, not only screenshot
- CTA appears at least 2 strategic positions
- Mobile layout is elegant, not compressed desktop clone

## Quality gate
- Readability on mobile (390px)
- Accessibility contrast acceptable
- Clear visual hierarchy in under 5 seconds scan
- Conversion path obvious without scrolling full page

## Output format
- Creative direction:
- Image strategy (sources/ratios/placements/alt text):
- UX layout decisions:
- UI tokens:
- Interaction spec:
- Builder handoff:
