# Premium Patterns for Personal Websites

## 1) Above-the-fold pattern
- Strong identity headline
- One-line value proposition
- Primary CTA + secondary low-friction CTA
- Social proof snippet (experience, outcomes, notable work)

## 2) Proof-first section
- Replace generic skill list with evidence blocks:
  - Problem
  - Action
  - Outcome

## 3) Visual signature
- One accent system (max 1-2 accents)
- Distinctive headline style
- Repeated motif (line, gradient, frame, texture) used consistently

## 4) Conversion patterns
- CTA after hero
- CTA after proof section
- Sticky mobile CTA when relevant

## 5) Motion discipline
- Use subtle transitions only
- Avoid heavy animation that harms speed
- Motion must reinforce hierarchy, not distract
