# Next.js Personal SEO

## 3-question intake (mandatory)
Only ask these 3 questions:
1. You are who? (role + years + niche)
2. Target audience and primary goal? (recruiter/clients/community + CTA)
3. Preferred style? (modern/minimal/cyber/premium + optional color mood)

Then proceed without extra questions using smart defaults.

## Smart defaults (no extra client friction)
- Stack: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + TypeScript
- Pages: Home, About, Projects, Contact
- Sections: Hero, trust badges, skills, featured work, CTA, footer
- Contact: mailto + social links placeholder
- Performance: image optimization, lazy sections, low JS first load
- Accessibility: semantic headings, contrast-safe palette, focus states
- Mobile-first: layout tuned for 390px first, then scale up

## SEO baseline (required)
- Title + meta description per page
- Canonical URL support
- OpenGraph + Twitter card
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml
- Schema JSON-LD: Person + WebSite
- Clean URL slugs for project details
- Internal links across key sections

## Content generation policy
- Keep copy concise and recruiter/client-friendly.
- Generate headline variants (3), pick strongest one.
- Include measurable credibility cues (years, impact, stack).
- Avoid generic buzzwords unless tied to proof.

## Delivery quality gate
Before handoff, ensure:
1) Lighthouse basics acceptable (Performance/SEO/Best Practices/Accessibility)
2) No layout break on mobile/tablet/desktop
3) All links and CTA paths valid
4) No blocking console errors
5) Build succeeds in production mode

## Output format

- Generated site map:
- SEO elements added:
